# After Completing Changes
- Run `npm run lint` to ensure Biome passes.
- When modifying conversion logic/UI, manually verify the page still renders and conversion toggles behave via local `npm run dev` session.
- For production readiness, build and export (`npm run build` + `npm run export`) if deployment is imminent.
- Update documentation (README or AGENTS.md) when altering specs or workflows.
